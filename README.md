![alt text](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/Speech.png "")<br/>
A **simple** and **offline** PDF audio reader using Python.


## How it works?

The task can be simply divided into 2 steps:

1. Extract text from PDF. Refer [read.py](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/read.py) for a sample.

2. Convert text to speech. Refer [speak.py](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/speak.py) for a sample.

[pdf_audio_reader.py](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/pdf_audio_reader.py) contains the complete code for python script.    
[pdf_audio_CLI.py](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/pdf_audio_CLI.py) contains the whole code for the Command Line Interface(CLI) of this project.   
[pdf_audio_GUI.py](https://github.com/venkywarriors619/Text-2-speech_python/blob/master/pdf_audio_GUI.py) contains the whole code for the GUI version of this project.
